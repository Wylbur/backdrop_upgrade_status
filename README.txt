-- SUMMARY --

Upgrade Status module was designed to provide an easy way tell when your website
is ready to be upgraded to the next Drupal version. The module will compile a
list of your projects along with a status, which can be one of the following:

* Available: A stable release of this project is available.
* In development: A development release of this project is available, which can
  be installed for testing purposes.
* Not ported yet: There are no releases available for this project.

Clicking on any of the modules' boxes will expand the area and show you a link
to download the new version of the project, as well as read its release notes.

If you've checked your projects out from CVS, you will need the CVS Deploy
module (http://drupal.org/project/cvs_deploy) in order for this module to be
able to read versions.
